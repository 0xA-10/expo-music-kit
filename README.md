### expo-music-kit [wip]

Apple MusicKit for React Native/Expo. Supports iOS and Web platforms.

It integrates together the JavaScript [MusicKit on the Web V3](https://js-cdn.music.apple.com/musickit/v3/docs) and the native Swift [MusicKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit).
